Python script to write commit message following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
This is a tool and not perfect, so please use it with caution.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3andan4/giti_super.git ~/.giti
sudo ln -s ~/.giti/giti /usr/bin/giti
```

## Known Issues
- The script will sometimes conflict with original git commit command
  - A fix is in the works
